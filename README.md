# A Bug or am I doing something wrong here?

This is a simple project demonstrating either a bug or my complete lack of understanding which, if the latter, I will retire into the hills of Saskatchewan, should I ever find one.

When presenting a screen modally inside a native Stack Navigator - on android - via `presentationStyle: modal`, everything works as one would expect. However, when I specify a `headerLeft` in the navigation options of the target screen, the title mysteriously disappears.

## Build and run

This is an expo project, so...

1. clone
2. yarn
3. yarn start
4. hit `a` to launch and run on Android
5. Press `f` to pay your respects
