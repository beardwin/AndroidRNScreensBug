# A Bug or am I doing something wrong here?

This is a simple project demonstrating either a bug or my complete lack of understanding which, if the latter, I will retire into the hills of Saskatchewan, should I ever find one.

When presenting a screen modally inside a native Stack Navigator - on android - via `presentationStyle: modal`, everything works as one would expect. However, when I specify a `headerLeft` in the navigation options of the target screen, the title mysteriously disappears.
